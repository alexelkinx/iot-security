  host can sometimes be computed.","To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line
  'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to apply the settings at
  runtime.

  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timestamps=disabled'

  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be completely disabled.

  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the Timestamp options when
  initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP peer that is initiating communication includes
  them in their synchronize (SYN) segment.

  See the references for more information.","TCP implementations that implement RFC1323/RFC7323.","The remote host implements TCP timestamps, as defined by
  RFC1323/RFC7323.","Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in
  between to the target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If found, the timestamps
  are reported.
