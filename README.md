## Topics Covered

- Ethical hacking principles and legal boundaries
- Secure network setup for IoT experimentation
- EdgeRouter X configuration and firewall rules
- Raspberry Pi setup as a Wi-Fi access point and Docker host
- Full IoT stack deployment using MQTT, InfluxDB, Node-RED, and Grafana
- Vulnerability scanning with Kali Linux and OpenVAS
- Secure firmware development for ESP32 devices

## Labs

1. [Lab 1: Environment Setup](lab-01-environment-setup/README.md)  
   Set up the secure testing environment including EdgeRouter X, Raspberry Pi with Docker-based IoT stack, and ESP32 MQTT example.
